                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    I am going to present a way to use a pre-trained model which is trained on Imagenet data and fine-tune it to identify Pneumonia.
                    My model uses a VGG16 pre-trained model trained on Imagenet data. My model takes an X-ray image as input and predicts whether the person has pneumonia or not with good accuracy.
                    I will be using Keras to implement this model. The model is directly available in Keras application.
                </p>

                <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Since there is no much data available for detecting pneumonia using the images of X-rays, we need to use a pre-trained model and use the same weights of that model. So we need to set the trainable property of the layers to false. The include_top = false makes sure that the last fully connected layers of the neural network of VGG16 are removed. See the code in my GitHub to understand what I mean.
                    Now I have fine-tuned my model by adding four additional fully connected layers that are trainable. These trainable layers will be trained to appropriately classify the Pneumonia. In the four fully connected layers three use Relu activation and one is the output layer.
                    The data is taken from the Kaggle website and has a sufficient amount of data to fine-tune the model.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>
                    After training the model for 50 epochs I got an accuracy of 92 percent on the training set and 87 percent on the test set.
                    This model can be further improved in a few ways and if I find time and resources I will update this post with an improved model.
                </p>
