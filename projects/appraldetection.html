                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    This project is a product recommendation software that recommends similar products given the customer chooses a product. 
                    Most of the huge companies use collaborative filtering or associate rules to recommend similar products. 
                    The disadvantage is that these algorithms require a huge amount of customer data, their preferences, and other details. 
                    Many of the new startups will not have access to this type of data. This project reads the data of the products, their images and then recommends 
                    similar products without having the need of the customer data. This project recommends similar products using the title of the product and the image of the product.
                </p>

                <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <p>
                    The project is implemented using two different technologies. The titles the processed using the google word2vec model and the images 
                    are processed using the VGG16 neural network. The titles are converted to vectors using the word2vec model and the euclidean distance 
                    between those vectors is calculated. The images are processed using the VGG16 and after the processing, the last layer is removed and 
                    the 128-dimensional vector of the last but one layer is used to calculate the euclidean distance. Based on the euclidean distance the top best similar products are recommended.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>
                    The project performs very well but not as good as the state of the art models which process far more data. This project can be implemented by 
                    a startup that does not have so much data and resources.
                </p>
