                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I have created a Content Management Blogging website for a University/College. The reason I have made this project is because I 
                    have done my bachelor’s in an Indian University. What I have learned during my bachelor’s is that seniors will have a lot of information 
                    that they have learned the hard way and was not useful to them but it can actually help juniors of the same college. This information can be anything but the seniors 
                    do not have the means of properly sharing it with many students. And the colleges also do not have any strong platform where teachers can share valuable information to 
                    all the students with ease. I have created a blogging system that has two types of users. One type of users are admins and other types of users are normal users. Admin has the most privileges.
                     They can delete users, remove post which does not fall into standards. Admins can view all the posts in the system. While a normal user can create posts, delete the post he/she created edit their post, view the number of views of their post, and other things.
                </p>

                <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <p>
                    The whole front end is implemented using HTML, CSS, js. The backend is implemented using PHP.
                    Users can can log in to the blogging website from the home page, once authenticated they can create, edit post 
                    of the wish. Each post has a title, content, and image, and users. They can view posts posted by other students and also search 
                    for a particular post. If the logged-in user is admin, he.she will have even more options like to delete posts of any user and other users and make 
                    users as admin. The system has a second layer of authentication. The user has to enter one time password when he/she wants to change the password. 
                    This is a complete full-stack developed PHP as a backend.

                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>
                    This project implements user authentication, giving privileges to different users, and one-time password authentication to password update.
